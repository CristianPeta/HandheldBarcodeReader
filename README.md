# HandheldBarcodeReader
Example of reading barcodes on Honeywell and Zebra handheld scanners with Android using a Delphi FMX project.

Many thanks to Brian Long (blong.com) for examples accessing Java code from Delphi and to St√©phane Wierzbicki with the help of restructuring the code.

If someone want to add barcode reading capability to own project it must look at:
1. Changes in AndroidManifest.template.xml
2. The libraries added to the project (com.symbol.emdk.jar, DataCollection.jar, honeywell.jar, NativeActivitySubclass.jar)
3. Add BarcodeReader in conditional defines
4. Code in the MainUI.pas
